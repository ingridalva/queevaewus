I'm currently in the evaluation period for Microsoft Intune and I see that Windows devices can be enrolled for management with Intune. Is it as capable with Windows devices as it is with mobile. 
Simplify modern workplace management and achieve digital transformation with Microsoft Intune. Create the most productive Microsoft 365 environment for users to work on devices and apps they choose, while protecting. I've been dabbling in using Azure AD and possibly InTune as a replacement for an on premesis AD domain with Group Policy. What's everyone's thoughts on InTune? Edit: Consensus seems to be that it's kinda junk. Good to know. Thanks everyone. Microsoft Intune. FYI. The abandoned subreddit r/Intune has been taken over and is now focused on Microsoft Intune questions and answers. Microsoft последовательно переводит в «облако» свои наиболее важные и популярные продукты. Windows Intune представляет собой готовое решение по защите и управлению. Howdy, We recently migrated to Office 365 and our Email is now hosted in the cloud. We want to make sure that our users who check their email from their phone are secure. This will only be for mobile device access and the only things we need to be able to do are: Require a password of some kind on the phone (preferably allow fingerprint, pattern, PIN, etc) and not just allow a simple swipe. Have the ability to do a Selective wipe on the phone if someone leaves the company Интеграция TeamViewer с Microsoft Intune позволяет с легкостью создать безопасный сеанс удаленной поддержки непосредственно из службы обзора предупреждений Intune.

According to the support representative the only supported settings for Intune are the simplified. Has anyone successfully implemented an Azure AD only / Intune deployment?

Now I have a hybrid setup and I would like to automatically join all my laptops in my organization to intune. Should I do this by autopilot or automatic enrolment?

Intune provides the data protection your business requires, while giving your employees access to the tools that make them most productive. You get an extensible admin experience integrated I'm trying to implent Intunes, and what can you actually do with Windows 10 devices on Intunes? It seems that with Intunes, all you can do is what you can already do with GPO (It doesn't even seem to be able to GPS location a lost laptop) where you can do that with IOS devices. amp#x200B; Is there any use to actually use Intunes for Laptops/tablets that are on W10? amp#x200B; thanks.

Thanks. Get started quickly with Microsoft Intune. Use the cloud-based enterprise mobility management (EMM) service to enable your workforce to be productive while keeping your corporate data protected. One for me, and maybe my biggest one, is the UI. It's awful. No ability to sort most columns makes it impossible to get meaningful data from search results. Say you have 5 VPP tokens and each token has a number of Chrome licenses. I have no way of knowing what Chrome license belongs to what VPP because it doesn't show that info in my app list. Trying to make one column wider makes the column next to it shrink. You can't searching and selecting multiple things is impossible. Microsoft Intune (formerly Windows Intune) is a Microsoft cloud-based management solution that provides for mobile device and operating system management. Hey Guys, amp#x200B; I wanted to get your thoughts on Intune being able to replace traditional GPOs. As we all begin to move to the cloud one of the biggest hurdles in my opinion is moving your Active Directory to Azure. If you are not going to spin up a DC in Azure then we can start to look at Azure AD for identity management and Intune for policy management.

Hello, Currently we have 50+ PC's running in W10. We deployed them in kioskmode with Windows autopilot. However now we want to upgrade all the PC's to 1809 so we can use the auto-pilot feature to set a device name. What would be the best approach to upgrade the devices in bulk? I've been reading about using an unattened.xml file on the USB drive that also has the higher windows ISO, this seems like a good option, however in the guides i've seen the unattended.xml also configures out-of-the-box.

Hello everybody, amp#x200B; Was wondering if any Intune Pro was around and able to answer a few questions (via PM), as I am setting up Intunes for our company and have basic questions about what Intunes could/couldn't and how some things have to be setup.

Hi, I've been tasked to assess to feasibility of centralising the management of \~20 PCs. It's for a new company, so we have little to no legacy. I'd say the worst legacy we have is an old shared printer. I don't want to use anything on-prem since our premises are not that secured and our company believes in the cloud approach.
