 Sarah Edison Knapp. I'm currently not planning to add legacy items - as far as I'm aware, the only currently viable build that uses them is zdog and I don't think they need a planner to tell them how many cooldown reduction they need. That said, I'd love to include more gear types in the future, including low level gear and legacy items. d3 planner ведет  Panda Planner  Увеличьте время, производительность и счастье с помощью Panda Planner.

Jeffrey H Rattiner Is there a way to upload character from PS4 ? Entering it manually is ridiculous plus it asks things I don’t know . I was entering command skeleton and it wanted me to enter dps . No where Hi there! I'm still calculating my rathma in D3 planner. On skill page I can see the skeletal mage skill damage data. And it says: "breakpoint: 32 frames" when I use attack speed I think I'm at the point of min maxing on my DH N6/M4 build (other than praying for primals and farming paragons) I haven't used D3planner much, so I'm wondering if there's a "bottom line" stat I should be focused on increasing. Am I just looking to increase my Effective DPS/Effective DPH stat? But then again, I'm not sure if this number would consider resource cost reduction. https://www.d3planner.com/611825665 (https://www.d3planner.com/611825665). Judy Allen.

This is frustrating though because I feel I should be doing 100 in 8-10 mins not 95 at 1k paragon with the buffed rathma. I havnt played in a few seasons and remember doing

I thought you could only enchant. Hello boys, ​ I am always looking to improve my game and one of the best ways to do that is to get better gear and learn more about the stats that are important to your build. I've heard about d3planner and I'd thought I give it a go. However, it's a bit too much for me at the start, and I was wondering whether I should keep at it and learn more about it. Is it a handy tool? Will it help me achieve my goals of improving my character. Arthur E. Jongsma. Sorry for creating another thread, since I couldn't rename my old one.

Quick question. I use the D3Planner very rarely just to see where I could potentially re-roll some gear or look for upgrades as it makes it easy to see what pieces you could put certain stats on. What I'd like to know is how to setup and run a simulation for a S6 Imaple DH, and also how to read that simulation. They seem to have some pre-loaded builds for UE Multi, M6 and Nats, but nothing for S6. If anyone has some steps or could screenshot a simulation for S6 Impale it'd be greatly appreciate. Kenny. How useful is the damage shown on the d3planner's save slots for determining how powerful my character actually is? I'm assuming this is the same damage indicator as the in game one when you bring up your character sheet. What I want to know is, if that damage indicator is a fairly accurate assessment and that I can use the planner to tweak my build accordingly to see what damage multipliers I should aim to increase OR is it actually leaving out a lot of situational components that can't.

When I import to D3 planner and run simulate, I get 69B DPS - this is with my Doombringer equipped.

I've been working on this project for quite some time, and have just finished the main features I intended to add. I still have a couple things The set text for Marauder clearly says each sentry multiplies damage by 600% times 5 it comes to a total of 3000% increased damage. However in D3 planner they use 400% (you can see them multiply it by 5 for the first sentry and after that times 4 which ends up being 21 thus 2000% total) Is it known that D3 planner Marauder percentage is off?

I do 2000% weapon damage per second to things in my slow time bubble. I almost always have things in my bubble, but I when I tick/untick the magnum opus set in the planner I don't see a change in my stats. Am I missing something? Edit: I just noticed that it does appear to be applying this bonus based on the tooltip, but it does not properly remove the bonus when I untick the magnum opus set. I will submit this as a bug to the author, but leave it here since eventually Google will crawl

So I'm currently playing on PS4 and this is my first season journey, I have been following the icy.veins N6M4 cold build but recently hit a wall trying to push higher Grifts.
